## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a software application designed to assist the elderly in managing their health and daily tasks efficiently. The application serves as a reminder system for medication, appointments, and other crucial tasks. Additionally, it includes a health tracking feature allowing users to input and monitor vital health metrics such as blood pressure and heart rate.

This Flask project incorporates several Operating System (OS) concepts:

1. **Threads:** Utilized for asynchronous tasks, such as scheduling reminders and checking health metrics, to prevent blocking the main application.

2. **File Handling:** Reading and writing JSON files to store and retrieve reminders, medications, appointments, and health metrics.

3. **Synchronization:** Implementing locks (`threading.Lock`) to manage access to shared resources (e.g., reminders and health metrics) to avoid data corruption when multiple threads access them concurrently.

4. **Process Control:** Flask handles multiple HTTP requests and responses as separate processes to manage the web application's functionalities.

5. **Timers and Polling:** Employing time-based functions (`time.sleep()`) for scheduling reminders and continuously checking the current time against scheduled reminder times.

6. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** Using HTTP methods like POST, GET, and DELETE for communication between the client (browser) and the server (Flask application) to perform actions like adding reminders, deleting records, and retrieving health metrics.

These concepts work together to facilitate the functioning of the application, manage data, handle user requests, and ensure concurrent operations without conflicts or data loss.

## Project Goals

1. **Enhance Daily Task Management:**
   - **Objective:** Develop a user-friendly interface to enable elderly individuals to easily add, view, and manage daily reminders for tasks, appointments, health metrics, and medication schedules.
   - **Rationale:** Empowering users to organize their daily activities fosters a sense of independence and reduces stress associated with memory lapses.

2. **Facilitate Health Data Tracking:**
   - **Objective:** Implement a system for tracking and recording health metrics, including blood pressure and heart rate, allowing users to monitor their health over time.
   - **Rationale:** Providing a tool for health data tracking contributes to proactive health management and encourages individuals to stay informed about their well-being.

3. **Ensure User-Friendly Interface:**
   - **Objective:** Design a graphical user interface (GUI) that is intuitive, accessible, and tailored to the needs of the elderly population.
   - **Rationale:** An easy-to-use interface ensures that the project is inclusive, accommodating users with varying levels of technological familiarity.

4. **Implement Persistent Data Storage:**
   - **Objective:** Develop mechanisms for persistent storage of reminders and health data, allowing users to access historical information.
   - **Rationale:** Persistent storage ensures that users can review past information, aiding in continuity of care and promoting long-term health tracking.

5. **Support Caregiver Collaboration:**
   - **Objective:** Provide features that allow caregivers to remotely view and manage reminders, fostering collaboration and support for elderly individuals.
   - **Rationale:** Inclusion of caregiver features ensures a holistic approach to elderly care, involving family members or support networks in the well-being of the user.

6. **Promote Mental Health Awareness:**
   - **Objective:** Implement features that encourage users and caregivers to stay aware of mental health through health data trends and proactive reminders.
   - **Rationale:** By promoting mental health awareness, the project contributes to a holistic approach to well-being, considering both physical and mental health aspects.

7. **Bridge Generational Digital Divide:**
   - **Objective:** Introduce technology in a manner that is accessible to older individuals, bridging the digital divide and ensuring inclusivity.
   - **Rationale:** Making technology accessible fosters social connection, reduces isolation, and encourages the elderly to engage with modern tools for their benefit.

8. **Create a Collaborative Health Ecosystem:**
   - **Objective:** Establish a platform that encourages collaboration among users, caregivers, and healthcare professionals, creating a supportive health ecosystem.
   - **Rationale:** Collaboration ensures a comprehensive approach to health management, involving multiple stakeholders for the benefit of the elderly individual.

## Code Structure

### The code is structured as follows:

**app.py:**

- Implements a Flask web application to manage reminders and health metrics.
- Defines routes for different functionalities (add, delete, display reminders, health tracker).
- Uses JSON files to store reminders and health metrics.

**index.html:**
- This structured HTML file is main home page from where user will chose where to redirect.
- The use of Tailwind CSS contributes to a visually appealing, animations and responsive design.
- The integrated JavaScript includes importing icons and loading.

**reminder.html:**
- This structured HTML file ensures a clear organization of the user interface components, including forms for adding reminders, displaying existing reminders, and facilitating user interaction.
- The use of Tailwind CSS contributes to a visually appealing and responsive design.
- The integrated JavaScript enhances the user experience by allowing the deletion of reminders without the need for page refresh.

**health.html:**
- This structured HTML file is made for health metrics page of the app. 
- It has container for health tracking with a reminder card, health tracking form for adding metrics, search feature for filtering metrics by date, list displaying existing health metrics, and javascript functions for searching, displaying, and deleting health records.

**Note:**

- Data Storage:
  * Reminders are stored as JSON files (`general_reminders.json`, `medications.json`, `appointments.json`) in app.py and reminder.html.
   * Health Metrics are stored as JSON file as well `health_data.json` via app.py and health.html.

**Communication:**
- The `app.py` script uses Flask to create a web interface and the logic is implemented in there.

- The `index.html` file is the main(home) page of the web application. It contains the HTML code for the web interface. It is frontend of the program.

- The `reminder.html` file is the reminder page of the web application. It contains the HTML code for the web interface. It is frontend of the program.

- The `health.html` file is the health metrics page of the web application. It contains the HTML code for the web interface. It is frontend of the program.

This outline provides an overview of the code structure, highlighting key functions, data storage, and the interaction between different components.
